<p>Cryptodev-linux is a device that allows access to Linux kernel cryptographic drivers; thus allowing
of userspace applications to take advantage of hardware accelerators. Cryptodev-linux is implemented as a standalone 
module that requires no dependencies other than a stock linux kernel.
It's API is compatible with OpenBSD's cryptodev userspace API (/dev/crypto).

  <li><a name="why"><b>Why use /dev/crypto</b></a>
    <p>Several small systems include a hardware crypto device that optimizes
    cryptographic operations with a 100x factor or even more comparing to a
    plain software implementation. Those systems usually provide kernel
    space drivers for those accelerators but they are not accessible from
    typical usespace programs and libraries such as <a href="http://www.gnutls.org">GnuTLS</a> or <a href="http://www.openssl.org">OpenSSL</a>. The
    /dev/crypto device is a middleware allowing access to the hardware
    cryptographic modules from user-space applications and thus providing
    the advantage of using them.

  <li><a name="alternatives"><b>Alternatives</b></a>
   <p><ul><li><a href="ncr.html">NCR</a> a Cryptographic Framework for Linux originally based on this one. Instead of simply providing cryptographic operations, it acts as a software security module.</li>
   <li><a href="http://ocf-linux.sourceforge.net/">OCF-linux</a> is a port of the OpenBSD Cryptographic
Framework to Linux that also includes the /dev/crypto interface. This unlike
cryptodev-linux does not use the native Linux crypto interfaces.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.logix.cz/michal/devel/cryptodev/">Cryptodev for Linux</a>. This is the old cryptodev
for linux implementation that cryptodev-linux is based on.</li>
<li><a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/410536/">Linux 2.6.38 AF_ALG</a>. Linux
2.6.38 introduced a sockets-based protocol to perform cryptographic operations.
It was proved to be pretty inefficient in modern hardware; we made a performance <a href="comparison.html">comparison with cryptodev-linux</a>.</li>
