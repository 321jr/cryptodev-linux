This is the linux-cryptodev [newapi] branch. Here a new API is being
designed. The ioctl() API is in ncr.h and the userspace in ncrypto.h.

For the new API to fully operate, root must load a system key (constant
per system) using the setkey program. After this stage the new API should
be fully operational. 

The main concept of the new API is disallow userspace applications
access to cryptographic keys. Operations should be possible (such
as encryption/decryption/signing/verifying), but raw access to the
keys will not be possible.



The old OpenBSD API via /dev/crypto device driver is still supported.

It was initially written for linux 2.6.8 by Michal Ludvig. Compatibility
fixes for *BSD cryptodev as well as porting to 2.6.27 blkcipher API 
by Nikos Mavrogiannopoulos. Initial blkcipher async API porting by
Michael Weiser.
